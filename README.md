A Short Course on R
===================

This repository contains the notes for a short course on R that I taught
(under the auspices of
[the star lab](https://www.rochester.edu/college/psc/thestarlab/)) to
first-year PhD students in political science at the University of Rochester.

The notes are licensed under a
[Creative Commons Attribution license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/),
which allows you to share and modify them as long as you attribute this work.
The notes draw some material from
[Jonathan Olmsted's version](https://github.com/olmjo/R-Intro) of the course.
I also recommend taking a look at
[Peter Haschke's version](http://www.peterhaschke.com/Teaching/R-Course/) of
the course, which has some very nice examples of data visualization with
`ggplot2`.
